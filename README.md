# KanCell: Augmented Dissection of Cellular Heterogeneity in Biological Tissues through Integrated Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics

![](docs/_static/img/figure1.png "Overview")
1.Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) achieves breakthrough feature representation and complex relationship capture.
2.KanCell model optimizes computational architecture to improve computational efficiency and capture deep dependencies.
3. End-to-end training enables flexible and optimized processing of complex spatial transcriptomics data.
